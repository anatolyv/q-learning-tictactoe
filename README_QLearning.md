```
 0 | 1 | 2
-----------
 3 | 4 | 5
-----------
 6 | 7 | 8
```

### Game Options
1. **Single Game**: Play one game against AI
2. **Tournament**: Play 5 games with alternating first player
3. **AI Statistics**: View trained model information

## üß† Q-Learning Implementation

### Algorithm Details
- **State Representation**: 9-digit string representing board positions
- **Action Space**: Integers 0-8 representing board positions
- **Reward Function**: +1 for win, -1 for loss, 0 for draw, -10 for invalid move
- **Exploration**: Epsilon-greedy with decay (starts at 1.0, decays to 0.01)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 (adjustable)
- **Discount Factor**: 0.95 (adjustable)

### Training Features
- **Self-Play**: Two Q-learning agents train against each other
- **Experience Replay**: Game history used for Q-value updates
- **Epsilon Decay**: Exploration decreases over time
- **Progress Tracking**: Win rates and statistics logged every 1000 episodes
- **Model Checkpoints**: Automatic saving during training

### Performance
After 10,000 self-play episodes:
- Q-table typically contains ~5,000-8,000 unique states
- Win rates stabilize around 40-45% each (with ~10-20% draws)
- Epsilon decays to minimum value (~0.01)
- Trained agents play near-optimally

## üìä Training Progress Visualization

The system generates training plots showing:
- Win rates over time for both players
- Epsilon decay curves
- Moving averages for trend analysis
- Cumulative game outcomes

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Training Parameters
```python
from training_system import TicTacToeTrainer

trainer = TicTacToeTrainer()

# Custom self-play training
agent_x, agent_o = trainer.train_self_play(
    num_episodes=20000,
    checkpoint_interval=2000,
    save_models=True
)
```

### Custom Agent Parameters
```python
from q_learning_agent import QLearningAgent
from tic_tac_toe_env import Player

agent = QLearningAgent(
    player=Player.X,
    learning_rate=0.1,        # How fast to learn
    discount_factor=0.95,     # Future reward importance
    epsilon=1.0,              # Initial exploration rate
    epsilon_decay=0.9995,     # Exploration decay rate
    epsilon_min=0.01          # Minimum exploration rate
)
```

### Model Management
```python
# Save trained model
agent.save_model("my_model.pkl")

# Load trained model
agent.load_model("my_model.pkl")

# View training statistics
agent.print_stats()
```

4. **Episodes 10,000+**: Near-optimal play, minimal improvement

## üé≤ Game Theory Notes

In perfect Tic-Tac-Toe play:
- First player (X) can force a win or draw
- Second player (O) can force a draw with optimal play
- Our Q-learning agents converge toward this optimal strategy

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No module named matplotlib"**: Install with `pip3 install matplotlib`
- **"No trained model found"**: Run training first or specify model path
- **Training seems slow**: Reduce number of episodes for testing

### Performance Tips
- Use self-play training for best results
- 10,000 episodes usually sufficient for good performance
- Save models regularly during long training runs
