# 🚀 Q-Learning Tic-Tac-Toe Deployment Guide

This guide shows you how to deploy your Q-Learning web app online for free!

## 📋 Files Ready for Deployment

✅ **Procfile** - Tells hosting services how to run the app
✅ **requirements.txt** - Lists all Python dependencies
✅ **Environment variables support** - App adapts to hosting platforms

## 🏆 Recommended: Railway.app (Easiest)

### Step 1: Prepare Repository
1. Push your code to GitHub (if not already done)
2. Make sure all files are committed:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Python app
   - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Run `python ql_web_ui.py` (from Procfile)
   - Provide a public URL

### Step 3: Access Your App
- Railway gives you a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- Your Q-Learning dashboard will be live! 🎉

## 🔧 Alternative: Render.com

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Connect GitHub account
3. Create "New Web Service"
4. Select your repo
5. Settings:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python ql_web_ui.py`
6. Deploy!

## 🎮 Alternative: Replit (Instant)

1. Go to [replit.com](https://replit.com)
2. Import from GitHub
3. Click "Run" button
4. Replit handles everything automatically
5. Get shareable URL instantly

## 🛠️ What These Files Do

### **Procfile**
```
web: python ql_web_ui.py
```
Tells hosting services to run the web UI as a web process.

### **requirements.txt**
```
numpy>=1.21.0
matplotlib>=3.5.0
flask
flask-socketio
```
Lists all Python packages needed.

### **Environment Variables Support**
The app now reads:
- `PORT` - Port number (set by hosting service)
- `HOST` - Host address (defaults to 0.0.0.0)
- `DEBUG` - Debug mode (defaults to False for production)

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build fails**: Check requirements.txt syntax
2. **App won't start**: Ensure Procfile has correct command
3. **Port errors**: Environment variables handle this automatically

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Test with environment variables
PORT=3000 python ql_web_ui.py
```
